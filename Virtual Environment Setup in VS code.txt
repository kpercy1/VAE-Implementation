Virtual Environment Setup in VS code

1. Ctrl + Shift + P, then select "Python: Select Interpreter". From here, can create a new virtual environment, venv.

2. Activate the virtual environment from the VS code terminal using the following command:
. .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Once this is done, the terminal should say something like (.venv) PS C:\Users\kperc\folder_name

3. Install ipykernel with the following command in VS code terminal:
pip install ipykernel
Then run the following command
& "C:\Users\kperc\VAE\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv --display-name "Python (venv)"

4. Make sure that the Jupyter kernel is connected to the virtual environment as well (this shows in the top right of VS code).

5. Install any required python packages from the VS code terminal. For example, the following commands might be useful:
pip install torchvision torch
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
